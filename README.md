# Customer Brand Preference Study (Acer vs. Sony)

## Goal and Objectives

In order for the Sales Team to decide with which brand of computers (Acer or Sony) to persue a deeper strategic relationship, 
a market research firm has been engaged to conduct a survey on Blackwell's existing customers.<br>
One of the objectives of the survey is to identify computer's brand preferences among the customers. <br>
A model is to be developed and tested in order to predict the customer's brand preference based on other demographis data of an 
incomplete survey. This will allow us at the same time to extrapolate the results of the survey to all the customers and persue 
specific marketing strategies.
